| Complications | |
|---------------|-|
| Motivation: Noblesse oblige | Zhuliya feels an obligation to help her lessers, especially her dependents. |
| Weakness: Fear | Zhuliya fears dying, and supernatural fear effects are especially hard to resist. |
| Balance: Malevolence | Zhuliya normally prefers conciliatory and diplomatic solutions, but the final draw messed up her head a bit. She'll still take obvious or superior diplomatic outcomes over fighting, but toss-ups will get to roll initiative. |

|Sidequests|
|----------|
|Tell them that the venerable Yanxiu Qimeng-Zhe wishes to restore the old rites and I will once again bless my descendants if they once again gather to sacrifice to me and my household, so the living may later join us in good standing and wealth.|
