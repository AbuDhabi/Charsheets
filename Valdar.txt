Fluff
Originally hailing from the north, from a somewhat savage tribe of Aesir worshippers, he left to wander the Earth and unlock the mysteries of his heritage. From family history, he is aware of the origin of the mild sorcerous powers he posseses, and is interested in learning more, as befitting a follower of Odin.

Deity: Odin, god of a bunch of things including Wisdom and Sorcery
