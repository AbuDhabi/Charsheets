# Advantages and Disadvantages
## Distinctions
| Famously Honest A |
|-|
| Other people have heard of you for your honesty, and they believe you by default unless given evidence to the contrary. |
| When performing a check for which you can leverage your reputation for telling the truth (such as a Command [Air] check to convince someone of a statement’s veracity, or a Commerce [Air] check to sell an item at an inflated price), you may reroll up to two dice. |

|Blessed Lineage V |
|-|
|Characters with status of 50 or higher understand that they might suffer a loss of prestige if they harm you, and thus do not choose to kill you as their first option, even if you are a political obstacle they would otherwise eliminate without hesitation.|
|When performing a check for which your esteemed lineage is a benefit (such as a Command [Void] check to challenge someone’s perception of a situation or a Government [Void] check to know the likelihood of a political eventuality), you may reroll up to two dice.|

## Adversities
| Bluntness A |
|-|
| You have difficulty expressing things indirectly, and you overlook insinuations and implications in the statements of others unless they are pointed out to you directly. |
| When you make a check to create or interpret subtext (such as a Design [Air] check to select a wardrobe that conveys the proper subtle message to your intended recipient or a Sentiment [Air] check to read someone’s unstated feelings), you must choose and reroll two dice containing Success or Explosive Success. After resolving the check, if you failed, you gain 1 Void point. |

## Passions
| Travel W |
|-|
|You are not unsettled by foreign customs, and you can comfortably fit in even in strange environments.|
|After performing a check to travel to a new location or interact with a novel thing (such as a Survival [Water] check to try to identify a new plant, animal, or phenomenon, or a Seafaring [Water] check to travel by boat), you remove 3 strife.|

## Anxieties
|Painful Honesty A|
|-|
|You are tormented by internal conflict when you lie or allow a lie to pass. You cannot make claims you know to be false, although you can say technically truthful things that imply untruths, if politeness or circumstances demand it.|
|After you make a check to mislead someone else (such as a Courtesy [Air] check to falsely besmirch someone’s reputation or a Command [Air] check to manipulate an underling), you receive 3 strife. If this is the first time this has occurred this scene, gain 1 Void point.|

| Softheartedness F |
|-|
|If given the choice to kill someone or show mercy, you always spare their life, even if it is not in your interest to let them live.|
|After performing a check that addresses or involves killing others or letting them die (such as a Government [Fire] check to estimate the burden a war would place on the common people or a Martial Arts [Ranged] [Fire] check to shoot to kill), you receive 3 strife. If this is the first time this has occurred this scene, gain 1 Void point.|

# Techniques

| Lord Togashi's Insight (Shuji) |
|-|
| Activation: Once per game session as an action, you may make a TN 2 Meditation (Void) check to seek cosmic wisdom regarding a quandary in front of you.|
| Effects: If you succeed, you receive a brief vision or hear the voice of Togashi providing a hint regarding one way you might proceed (which the GM should furnish). This hint should not be the full answer, but it should help you move forward toward a solution or at least formulate a plan of action. |
| New Opportunities: Void: Reduce the TN of your first check to overcome the problem you are facing by your school rank (to a minimum of 1). |

| Earthen Fist (Kiho) |
|-|
| Activation: As an Attack and Support action, you may make a TN 1 Martial Arts [Unarmed] (Earth) check to empower your unarmed blows. When you perform this action, you may choose a character at range 0–1 as the target for the burst effect. |
| Enhancement Effect: While this kihō is active, treat the base damage of your unarmed punch and kick profiles (see page 237) as being increased by your Earth Ring. While this kihō is active, increase your physical resis tance by 1. |
|Burst Effect: If you succeed with two or more bonus successes, you deal physical damage to the target equal to your Earth Ring, and your target must resist with a TN 4 Fitness check (Air 2, Water 5) or suffer the Prone condition. |
| Tattoo: Boulders on right fist. Add bonus successes equal to school rank on successful activation. |

| Earth Needs No Eyes (Kiho) |
|-|
| Activation: As a Support action, you may activate this kihō. When you do so, you may make a TN 1 Meditation (Earth) check to gain an awareness of your surroundings. |
| Enhancement Effect: If you succeed, this kihō activates. While this kihō is active, you can use vibrations through the earth to “see” a number of range bands in all directions equal to your Earth Ring. While this kihō is active, increase your vigilance by your Earth Ring.|
| Burst Effect: If you succeed with three or more bonus successes, you instantly become aware of all living creatures and objects touching the ground within a number of range bands equal to your Earth Ring plus your bonus successes. |
